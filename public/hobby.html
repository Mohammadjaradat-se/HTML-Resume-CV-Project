          Believe it or not, as a software engineer, my hobby was not originally staring at computers, playing video games, or even writing code during my early years. No—not at all.
          My true hobby was rap music. Yes, rap. <br/>
          This art form, which I first heard when I was 14 years old, never left my mind. It became my musical taste, and I didn’t stop there. I entered the field, learned it, and became skilled at rapping. Through rap, I discovered myself, uncovered my ideas, got to know who I truly am, and expressed those thoughts. For me, it was an escape from everything.<br/>
          Rap was my hobby—it’s where it all began. The story started when I was 14 years old. I used to listen to rap songs by well-known hip-hop artists such as Tupac, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, The Notorious B.I.G., Ice Cube, 50 Cent, and many other international rappers. I also listened to Arab rappers like Klash, Slow moe, Shaiboba, Ahmed Mekky, as well as Synaptik, Shabjdeed, and others.<br/>
          The idea started forming in my mind: What if I could become like them? Why not try?<br/>
          So I began writing lyrics, learning rhyme schemes, flow, and vocal delivery. I learned how to listen to beats, choose instrumentals, and fit words onto rhythms with a style and flow that attract listeners.<br/>
          Rap became the hobby through which I discovered myself and realized that I truly excel at it. Rap is not just music and instruments—it is an art that expresses every human state. It reflects thoughts, revolutions, sadness, joy, and everything a person can feel. To me, it is the greatest art of all—the art of the street.
